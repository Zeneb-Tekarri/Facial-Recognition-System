# Facial-Recognition-System


### Project Title
**Facial Recognition System Implementation**

### Description
The project focuses on developing a facial recognition system using artificial intelligence techniques. This system is designed to automatically identify and recognize faces in real-time using video input from a camera. It is particularly aimed at enhancing security and access control applications.

### Technology Used
1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: PyCharm
3. **Libraries**:
   - **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing.
   - **NumPy**: For handling multi-dimensional arrays and numerical operations.
   - **Face Recognition**: For detecting and recognizing faces in images.
   - **OS**: For interacting with the operating system.
   - **Datetime**: For managing date and time information.

### Key Features
1. **Facial Detection**: Identifying human faces in images.
2. **Facial Recognition**: Matching detected faces against a pre-trained database.
3. **Attendance Logging**: Recording the name and time of detection in a CSV file.
